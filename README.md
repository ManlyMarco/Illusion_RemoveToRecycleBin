# KK_RemoveToRecycleBin
Plugin for Koikatu! that moves removed/overwritten cards to the recycle bin to prevent accidentally losing your work. You can restore the overwritten and deleted cards back to the original folder then. This works for character cards, coordinate cards and studio scenes.

### How to use
1. Make sure at least [BepInEx v4.1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed, and your game is updated.
2. Download the latest release.
3. Place the .dll inside your BepInEx folder, overwrite if asked.
4. Start character maker, save a new card and then delete it. Check if it appears in your recycle bin.

*WARNING:* Do not rely on this plugin in your normal daily use! It relies on the recycle bin, which sometimes can get cleaned by other applications, or can be briefly inaccessible in which case the card will be removed permanently.
